<h3>Pursuit of Happiness</h3>
<p>I like will smith in this movie. He was a great actor.</p>
<h3>Book of Eli</h3>
<p>I like post-apocalpytic stuff. It seems fun to live in on paper.</p>
<h3>Zeitgeist</h3>
<p>I like conspiracy stuff. Whether it's true or not I just like being open to different ideas and thoughts.</p>
